[front door shutting, box dropping to the floor]
 
(sigh)And I think *that* makes me officially moved in.
 
 
Yeah, I did a whole sweep through the old apartment and this was the last box.
No, it's not that I don’t own much, it's that you have so much stuff that every time we move you we have to hire a whole team of people to do it. (laughs)
 
 
I know I keep saying it but I do really appreciate you letting me move into your place…
Well…
*Our* place I guess now (nervous laugh)
 
 
I know you aren’t super hot on this idea of us living together so I’ll do my best to make it as short as possible.
And I’ll try to not make it too painful for you.
I don’t want you regretting opening your door to me.
 
 
Maybe it’s not that big of a deal for you, but it is for me.
You really saved my ass here.
 Who’d have guessed that Jack would want to move in his girlfriend and kick me out of the apartment with only a week’s notice.
 
 
*Yeah*, I know you warned me not to move in with him but it was there and it was cheap... (sigh)
… and I should've listened to you.
 
 
Yeah, yeah you were right.
As usual (laughs)
I’m never gonna live that down, am I?
 
 
Apartment hunting has been going alright, I guess.
I have been sending some messages out to people online looking for roommates.
So far nothing but I’m pretty easy to live with so I can’t imagine it’ll take *too* long to find something.
 
 
(nervous)So there is… um
Can I…can I ask why you don’t seem to want me to move in?
Not just for a few weeks, like, *move in* move in.
(flustered) Like it's fine that you don’t, it's just…
You know we have been friends for so long now..
I…I guess I thought it could be kind of fun living together but, do you not think so?
 
 
(dejected) Yeah, I guess they do say that you shouldn’t live with your friends…
 
But think about it!
It’ll be like sleepovers every night and I know how much you like my midnight margaritas and you know I’m a decent cook so I can keep you in hot meals and good show recommendations. (laughs)
 
I think it’s just been getting to me a little bit that you aren’t as excited about this as I am.
 
Are you worried that I’m gonna be too messy to live with?
 
Or that I’ll eat all your food?
 
Cuz I promise I’m a good, possibly even *great*, roommate.
No complaints on my track record.
Jack may have kicked me out, but he can be a good reference that my quality of roommate-ness has *nothing* to do with the reason I was cast out on the streets. (laughs)
 
 
Seriously though…
It’s not that you think that I’m gonna try to make a move on you or something?
Cross my heart and hope to die, I would never do anything to make you uncomfortable.
 
 
That’s not it?
I mean what else could make you not want me, your best friend of…how many years now, to live with you.
Okay so…
 
I mean.
(joking) It’s not like you have a crush on me. (laughs)
 
(realization)
Oh..
Oooh!
 
Wait.
Do you…
Do you have a crush on me?
 
Oh my god.
You have an honest to god crush on me.
 
 
Holy shit.
 
That’s why you are being so weird about all of this?!
 
 
No, no sorry I didn’t mean *weird* I just meant..
Fuck…
Start over.
 
Do you have a crush on me?
 
 
You do…
Since when?
 
 
(spluttering) That long?
 
And you never said anything?
 
 
I mean I’m not gonna say I *never* noticed the way you look at me sometimes.
But I didn’t want to assume that it was anything more than just a passing thought.
 
 
Well how was I supposed to react, huh?
(dryly joking) Was I supposed to whisk you into my arms at the first flutter of your lashes?
(joking to serious by the end) Was I supposed to fall to my knees for you when I noticed the way your eyes raked over me?
Because baby I was a moment away from doing just that.
 
 
Oh my god and you thought *I* was blind to the signs. (dry laugh)
Fucking hell…
I have been obsessed with you for *years*.
 
 
Oh you don’t get to turn the “you never said anything” back on me now.
 
 
Because, I…
Fuck..
I just really didn’t want to fuck up the best thing in my life.
 
(speaker crowds listener’s space till she is pressed against the wall)
Even if I have to stand by your side as you date other guys, you are, and always will be, the best part of my life.
And not even for a second could I jeopardize losing you if I said something and it made it weird between us. 
Because losing you is not something I would ever be able to come back from.
 
[kissing](desperate)
 
I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it.
 
[kissing cont]
 
(breathless)I can’t breathe when you aren’t beside me.
 
[cont]
 
(growly and breathless) Ugh. Fuck.
Holy shit- okay hold on.
 
I need to be sure we are on the same page here.
I can’t do…*this* unless you are sure this is what you want.
Like *really* want.
 
 
You aren’t some hookup to me.
(rushed)You are my everything and if you can’t handle that I will understand and we can pack this away like nothing happened.
But…if you want this…
 
[kissing]
 
 
Fuck.
Okay, you’re right.
Enough talking.
 
[cont.]
 
Just lean against the wall baby.
I’ve got you.
 
 
Oh you like that?
You like feeling my thigh between your legs?
 
What about when my mouth is on your neck?
Hmm?
 
[kisses down listener’s neck]
 
Oh, you’re so fucking hot when you grind onto my thigh like that.
 
I didn’t say stop.
 
Does it feel good?
 
 
Yeah?
(darker) Then don’t fucking stop.
 
 
Baby I’ve had to listen to you tell me about all your sexual exploits for years.
Of course I’ve been taking fucking notes.
(growly) Now grind.
 
(moan)
Much better.
 
[kissing cont]
 
(breathless) Can I please take off some of this clothing?
I *need* to see you.
 
 
Yeah?
 
 
(relief) Thank you.
 
[clothing removal]
 
Fuck…
 
You are so beautiful.
 
 
No, really.
You are breathtaking and I will spend the rest of my life thanking you for letting my eyes take you in.
 
 
You want me to lose some layers too? (laughs softly)
 
 
All of them?
Your wish is my command, love. 
 
[clothing removal]
 
Is that better?
 
 
You like what you see, baby?
Do you like seeing how crazy you drive me?
 
That the feel of your lips has me throbbing for you.
[kiss]
 
The way the heat of your body has driven me to the edge of my sanity.
[kiss]
 
The way your tits press against my bare skin makes me want to pin you down to the floor and take you right here.
 
But I’m not going to fuck you for the first time on the floor of the hallway like a fucking animal.
I want you laid out like a feast for me in your bed when I make you scream my name.
Now go.
 
[spank sfx]
 
(laughs) If you didn’t want me to smack your ass, baby, you shouldn’t have such a cute one.
 
[footsteps to bedroom and bed creaks as listener lays down]
 
(groan)
Much better.
 
You’re so good at following directions for me, love.
Think you can follow another?
 
 
Yeah?
 
Spread your legs for me.
Let me see you.
 
Fuuck.
I could write poems about every inch of your skin.
But I’m not much of a writer so you’ll have to settle for me on my knees and my tongue on you instead.
 
 
[speaker drops to his knees and kisses up listener’s thighs]
 
 
God, I’m obsessed with your thighs.
 
 
Yeah, really.
Every time you wear a short dress or skirt or those little shorts of yours all I can think about is having my head right here between them.
 
Now, you need to be a good girl and hold still.
I have been waiting *years* for the moment I could finally taste you.
 
[cunnilingus sfx]
(groan)
 
Oh fuck, baby.
You’re everything I could’ve imagined and more.
 
[cont]
 
Oh my god you are absolutely dripping.
 
Is this all for me?
 
 
Yeah?
Oh what a good girl you are.
 
[cont]
 
That’s it baby.
Grab my hair, just like that.
(groans)
You can pull as hard as you want.
 
Move me wherever you need me.
 
[cont]
(listener pulls speaker’s head away)
 
Hey!
I didn’t say I was done.
 
[kiss]
 
Mmm.
You just wanted to taste yourself on my lips, didn’t you?
 
Mhmm.
I see right through you, babygirl.
 
[kissing]
 
God, your hands on me feel great.
 
Mhmm
 
(listener grabs speaker’s dick)
Oh, fuck.
Especially there.
Holy shit.
 
You greedy, greedy girl.
Just can’t keep your hands off of me.
 
I did *not* say to stop.
 
(groan)
Oh fuck.
 
Let go.
 
 
I promise you can keep going in a second.
Just let go.
 
[spits]
 
Now keep going.
 
(moan)
That’s it.
Slower.
 
You don’t want to get me so worked up that this ends too quickly, do you?
 
Mhmm
Nice and slow, baby.
 
[kissing]
 
(teasing) Oh, so you can drive me insane with your hands but I can’t return the favor?
I see the way your hips twitch every time I circle your clit.
I can hear that little whine starting in your throat as I (groan) push a finger into you.
 
[fingering sfx]
 
So don’t try to lie to me.
 
You want my hands on you.
 
You want my hands *in* you.
 
And I want to feel every little jerk and flutter you can give me.
 
[cont. and kissing]
 
Hmm?
What was that?
 
 
Please?
 
Please what, baby?
 
I’m so sorry baby. Not quite yet.
The first time I see you cum, I need it to be on my cock.
 
 
Oh, I’m mean?
I’m so mean as I pump my fingers into you and rub your pretty little clit?
 
[sfx slow to a stop]
 
Oh baby.
I suppose I can finally give you what you want, hmm?
 
[repositioning sfx]
 
God you are gorgeous underneath me like this.
Let me know if it’s too much, okay?
 
[speaker pushes in]
 
Holy fuck.
You’re so tight and so fucking wet.
 
(groan) You take me so well, baby.
 
[sex sfx start]{lengthen, add groans/moans, and kissing sfx as feels natural}
 
Keep looking at me.
 
I wanna see those pretty eyes of yours.
 
Oh my god, yes.
God, I love you.
 
 
I really do.
I fucking love you
 
[kissing]
 
That’s it.
Fuck, I’ve got you.
 
Just hold onto my shoulders.
Yeah, just like that.
 
You are so gorgeous and so perfect.
I love the way my hands look on your body
(groan) I’m obsessed with the feel of your legs around me.
 
Just like that.
Pull me in tighter.
Play with that pretty little clit for me.
 
 
Fuck, baby.
I’m getting close.
Mhmm.
 
 
I want you to cum with me.
 
Mhmm.
 
[speed up]
 
That’s it.
 
Take it baby.
Take it for me.
 
You’re close?
 
 
Yeah, I’m so close, baby.
Where do you want it?
 
 
Holy fuck.
 
Yes.
Yes I wanna cum in you.
Oh my fucking god.
 
You’re gonna cum when I tell you, okay?
You’re ready?
 
 
Oh, fuck.
Now.
Cum for me baby.
Cum for me.
Cum for me.
 
 
[speaker orgasm]
 
Oh, fuck 
(laugh)(breathing hard)
 
Oh my god (laughs again)
 
You are a vision.
You are everything I could’ve hoped for and more.
[playful kissing]
 
Okay baby, just (laughs)
Hold still for me, okay?
 
I’m just gonna (groan as speaker pulls out)
Sorry, I’m just a little sensitive (laughs)
 
I’m just going to snuggle in next to you here.
 
[readjusting]
 
That’s it, love.
Just lay against my chest and breathe for a minute.
 
 
No, no.
Shhh.
We don’t have to talk about it right now.
 
(softly) Just close your eyes and relax.
We can figure out what’s next later.
For now…
[kiss]
I just want you to get some rest.
 
 
I love you so much, baby
 
[suggested fade out on soft breathing]
